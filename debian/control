Description: FreeType-based font drawing library for X
 Xft provides a client-side font API for X applications, making the FreeType
 font rasterizer available to X clients.  Fontconfig is used for font
 specification resolution.  Where available, the RENDER extension handles
 glyph drawing; otherwise, the core X protocol is used.

Description: FreeType-based font drawing library for X (unstripped)
 Xft provides a client-side font API for X applications, making the FreeType
 font rasterizer available to X clients.  Fontconfig is used for font
 specification resolution.  Where available, the RENDER extension handles
 glyph drawing; otherwise, the core X protocol is used.

 This package provides an unstripped shared object with debugging symbols,
 useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in a debugger; this
 facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding logic errors in
 programs using this library (or the library itself).  The library is
 installed in /usr/lib/debug and can be used by placing that directory in the
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable when the code to be debugged is
 executed.  Non-programmers will likely have little use for this package, and
 should use libxft2 instead.
